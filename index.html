        <div class="about_me"><p>My name is Aidan Jacobson, and I'm a freshman when I made this profile. I want to continue my goal to get better at Computer Science and make a game. I would like to work at any gaming company. I would also like to make a game with some of my friends because we have the same passion. I believe we will also have good communication with others.</p></div>
